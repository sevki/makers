//! `BUILD.bazel` generation from a resolved make graph.
//!
//! This is [#632][pr] done as a plugin. That version put the emitter in
//! `src/depgraph.rs` behind a new `--dump-bazel` option, which is the shape
//! every such feature takes when the build tool has no plugin interface: a
//! flag in the getopt table, a module in the core, and a CI job that has to
//! be maintained alongside make itself. The output here is the same
//! per-package genrules; what changed is who owns them.
//!
//! [pr]: https://github.com/sevki/makers/pull/632
//!
//! Three things the plugin interface buys over the in-core version:
//!
//! * **Order-only prerequisites are excluded from `srcs`.** `foo.o: foo.c |
//!   build/` names `build/` as an ordering constraint, not an input. The
//!   in-core version emitted it as a `srcs` label, and Bazel then demands a
//!   target that produces a directory nobody declared. `node.dep-edges()`
//!   carries the flags, so the distinction is available here; the graph
//!   walk #632 used had no flags on its edges at all.
//! * **It runs under a capability grant.** Recipe text is where credentials
//!   end up, and this plugin transcribes recipes verbatim into files that
//!   get committed. `read-recipes` being withheld is a supported mode:
//!   the dump degrades to `cmd = "true"` genrules that still describe the
//!   dependency structure.
//! * **It cannot write outside its declared root.** The in-core version
//!   called `std::fs::write` on a path derived from a target name, so a
//!   makefile with a target named `../../etc/thing` wrote there. Here the
//!   root is declared and every entry path is confined to it by the host.
//!
//! It never needs `expand-variables`: a genrule wants the recipe *mostly*
//! unexpanded, because Bazel does its own expansion and the automatics the
//! two tools share have to survive into the generated file rather than being
//! substituted away. Plain variables are the exception — Bazel has no `CC`,
//! so `$(CC)` left alone becomes a genrule that runs `CC` as a command — and
//! those are substituted in the *target's* scope through `node.variable()`,
//! which needs only `read-variables`.
//!
//! It deliberately does **not** declare `deterministic`, even though its
//! output is a pure function of what it reads. `session.input-digest` covers
//! per-target variables but not the global set, so `make CC=gcc` and
//! `make CC=clang` over one makefile produce the same digest and different
//! correct output. Until the digest covers globals, any plugin reading them
//! has to decline the promise; see the note in `docs/plugin-api.md` §9.
