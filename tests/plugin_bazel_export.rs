//! End-to-end tests for `plugins/bazel-export`.
//!
//! The plugin is the reason `artifacts` grew a `directory` output, so these
//! tests are as much about that interface addition as about the Bazel
//! translation: a plugin that names its own entries at runtime is a new
//! shape of authority, and the interesting assertions are about where those
//! entries are and are not allowed to land.
//!
//! Every test runs the real `make` binary against a real component. See
//! `tests/plugin_common/mod.rs`. Requires the component to be built:
//! `(cd plugins/bazel-export && cargo component build)`.

// The plugin host is behind an optional feature, so without it there is no
// `make` binary that loads components and every assertion here would fail
// against a build that simply ignores `MAKERS_PLUGINS`. Same gate as the
// two sibling suites.
